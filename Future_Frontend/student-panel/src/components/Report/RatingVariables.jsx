        <ul>
          <li><h5>Likeability</h5></li>
          <p align='justify'>
            All of us have heard and likely commented, “I like that guy/pal!” The meaning of likeability says that the smile is the main ingredient of liking
            an individual. Researchers have shown that ability to smile and remain stress free are important points of a successful interview. How much and
            how frequently you smile indicates subtle indications that you are in control of the conversation. This should not be confused with laughter.
            Our AI generated algorithms produce proprietary scores that divide this soft skill of Likeability into four cohorts or groups as a relative
            barometer of the candidate's likeability.  So how can you be more likable? Simple, practice delivering the answers with smiles as if you are
            talking to a friend. The top cohort or group rating (A) on more that 75% of the questions denotes a high degree of proficiency in this soft skill
            that should be aimed.
          </p>
          <li><h5>Charm</h5></li>
          <p align='justify'>
            Who doesn't want to be charming? Did you know that certain body language markers like eye movement and gaze signals how charming you appear?
            Human resource experts and researchers have discovered that some of these markers can indicate charm that the interviewer in your favor in a
            subconscious way. Our AI generated algorithms produce proprietary scores that divides this soft skill of Charm into four cohorts or groups as a
            relative barometer of the candidate's charm. This should not be confused with excessive expressions. So how can you improve your scores? Simple,
            practice delivering the answers looking directly at the camera with steady gaze without getting distracted by other elements. The top cohort
            rating (A) on more than 75% of the questions denotes high degree of proficiency in this soft skill that should be aimed.
          </p>
          <li><h5>Confidence</h5></li>
          <p align='justify'>
            Do you use a lot of filler words like “actually”, “really”, “like” and others? Many of us have the habit of doing so in our subconscious minds.
            This creates a negative impression in the minds of the interviewers that the candidate is over confident. Researchers have discovered that we
            often associate the table of “low-confidence” with such candidates. Our algorithms generate proprietary scores that divide this soft skill of
            Confidence into four cohorts as a relative barometer of the candidate's confidence. This should not be confused with wordplay. So how can you
            improve your scores? Simple, think and answer confidently without any filler words. The top cohort rating on more than 75% of the questions
            denotes a high degree of proficiency in this soft skill that should be aimed.
          </p>
          <li><h5>Energy</h5></li>
          <p align="justify">
            Did you ever heard a comment “Wow he was super high energy!” The strength of our voice, voice modulation and pitch of sound is the most important
            thing. It makes difficult ideas easy to understand and refers to the interviewer that the candidates know his/her “stuff”. Our AI algorithms
            generate proprietary scores that divide this soft skill of energy into four cohorts as a relative barometer of the candidate's energy. This should
            not be confused with merely a loud voice. So how can you improve your scores? Simple, practice delivering the answers with good voice modulation
            and pitch range along with a normal voice. The top cohort rating (A) on more than 75% of the questions denotes a high degree of proficiency in
            this soft skill that should be aimed.
          </p>
          <li><h5>Fluency</h5></li>
          <p align="justify">
            We all want to sound fluent in the interviews but whether due to the pressure or tension, we tend to fumble with words and take long awkward
            pauses. This is exactly opposite to a good candidate who always appears to be fluent. Our AI algorithms generate proprietary scores that divide
            this soft skill of fluency into four cohorts or groups as a relative barometer of the candidate's fluency. This should not be confused with merely
            rapid speech. So how can you improve your scores? Simple, practice delivering the answers with which are well thought out. Request for a minute to
            formulate your answers before you start speaking so that unnecessary pauses can be avoided. The top cohort rating (A) on more than 75% of the
            questions denotes a high degree of proficiency in this soft skill that should be aimed.
          </p>
          <li><h5>Content Ratings</h5></li>
          <p align="justify">
            We evaluate the content of the responses not only by comparing it to the best possible answer to that question but also using our context cloud
            and in this way we further enhance the accuracy of our content rating. Any candidate taking time to understand and align to the context in which
            he is operating and using industry-specific terminologies to articulate his point of view is likely to do well in the content ratings. The top
            cohort rating (A) on more than 75% of the questions denotes a high degree of proficiency and accuracy in his answers.
